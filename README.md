# CTM - Conference Track Management

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals
which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting
them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities!
So you write a program to do it for you.

 * The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
 * Each session contains multiple talks.
 * Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
 * Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
 * The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
 * No talk title has numbers in it.
 * All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
 * Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

### Ruby version

* ruby 2.2.1

### Configuration

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Valmasso/ctm.git
cd ctm
bundle install
```

### How to run the test suite

```

### How to run the project
